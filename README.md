#Comparison

I have merged the two programs into a single one so that it may be used for comparison.

Please create a "New Folder" and keep the "Comparison.py" Python Program File and the "Input Data.xlsx" Excel file  into that folder.

Allow the program to run as long as possible. After you terminate the program, you will see the "Comparison Table" in the "New Folder" as well as a new Images Folder is created where the images are captioned accordingly. The "Images" Folder will have multiple folders numbered according to the number of Nodes used.

The more time the program is run, the more number of such folders will be created automatically for comparison.
